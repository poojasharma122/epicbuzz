                    <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on
                        applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and
                        limitations may not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in
                        this section shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.
